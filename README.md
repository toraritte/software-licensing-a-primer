A primer that I wrote for a proposal, but mainly to myself to get a better understanding about how software licensing works. It is unfinished, and any inaccuracies are mine alone.

# Contribution guidelines

Feel free to submit a pull request, if you find any typos or untrue statements, disagree with phrasing or have any suggestions for improvement. If you make edits, please take into consideration that the proposal uses [Pandoc's markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) format. Thank you!

[`./dependencies`](dependencies/) holds files that [`pandoc`](http://pandoc.org/) uses to generate HTML output (among others). It also contains a [build script](dependencies/build-github-page) to build the [projects Github page](https://toraritte.github.io/software-licensing-primer/).

[`./scratchpad`](scratchpad/) contains notes and other resources waiting to be incorporated.
