A primer that I wrote for a proposal, but mainly to myself to get a better understanding about how software licensing works. It is unfinished, and any inaccuracies are mine alone.

A good book on the topic is [Understanding Open Source and Free Software Licensing](http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/osfreesoft/) from Andrew M. St. Laurent published in 2004. It is freely available by courtesy of O'Reilly's [Open Books Project](http://www.oreilly.com/openbook/).
