A primer that I wrote for a proposal, but mainly to myself to get a better understanding about how software licensing works. It is unfinished, and any inaccuracies are mine alone.

The document uses [Pandoc's markdown](https://pandoc.org/MANUAL.html) format, but I was trying to keep to the standards. The [build script](dependencies/build-github-page) always has the latest commands to generate the HTML output.

[`./dependencies`](dependencies/) holds files that the [build script](dependencies/build-github-page) uses in its arguments to build the [projects Github page](https://toraritte.github.io/software-licensing-a-primer/).

[`./scratchpad`](scratchpad/) contains notes and other resources waiting to be incorporated.
