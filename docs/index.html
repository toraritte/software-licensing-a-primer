<h2 id="brief-history">1 Brief history</h2>
<h4 id="s">1970s</h4>
<p>Computers are built from scratch by research organizations and custom software has to be written to operate them. “Software was not yet standardized and was not considered to be a monetizable product.”<span class="citation" data-cites="roads-and-bridges">[<a href="#ref-roads-and-bridges">2</a>]</span></p>
<h4 id="roads-and-bridges">1981<span class="citation" data-cites="roads-and-bridges">[<a href="#ref-roads-and-bridges">2</a>]</span></h4>
<p>IBM introduces the “IBM PC” or “Personal Computer”. Industry adoption is high, winnowing out the competition and capturing half of the market share by 1986.<span class="citation" data-cites="from-altair-to-ipad">[<a href="#ref-from-altair-to-ipad">3</a>]</span></p>
<p>Standardized hardware brought along the opportunity to standardize software. IBM hires Microsoft to write the operating system for their PC and they deliver MS-DOS in the same year. Other companies follow suit.</p>
<p>Turning software into business proves lucrative, resulting in commercial licenses promoting the creation of proprietary products, preventing users from copying, modifying or redistributing software.</p>
<h4 id="section">1983</h4>
<p>Concern rises among computer scientists “<em>about the closed and proprietary direction that software was taking</em>”.<span class="citation" data-cites="roads-and-bridges">[<a href="#ref-roads-and-bridges">2</a>]</span> As a response, Richard Stallman launches GNU, a free operating system, also inadvertently laying the foundation for the “free software movement”.<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.gnu.org/gnu/initial-announcement.html"><strong>???</strong></span></span></p>
<h4 id="section-1">1985</h4>
<p>Stallman founds the Free Software Foundation to support the objectives of the “free software movement”.<span class="citation" data-cites="gnu-initial">[<a href="#ref-gnu-initial">4</a>]</span></p>
<h4 id="section-2">1992</h4>
<p>The growth of the World Wide Web gains momentum and becomes more widely available.</p>
<h4 id="section-3">1996</h4>
<p>The commercialization of the web begins with great success and huge gains.</p>
<h4 id="section-4">1998</h4>
<p>In a move unprecented at the time from a software company, Netscape releases the source code of its high market-share web browser. This event becomes the catalyst to a group of technologists, who have been advocating a more pragmatic approach to the Free Software Foundation’s principles, to create the Open Source Initiative. The new organization’s focus is to promulgate “<em>the practical benefits of free software</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="roads-and-bridges">[<a href="#ref-roads-and-bridges">2</a>]</span> without “<em>the ideological and confrontational connotations of the term</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="open-source-movement-wiki">[<a href="#ref-open-source-movement-wiki">5</a>]</span></p>
<h2 id="open-source-versus-free-software">2 Open source versus free software</h2>
<h3 id="common-ground">2.1 Common ground</h3>
<p>Both <strong>free software</strong> and <strong>open source software</strong> do roughly mean the same:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>According to the <a href="https://www.fsf.org/">Free Software Foundation</a>’s summary, it means that “<em>users have the freedom to run, copy, distribute, study, change and improve the software</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="gnu-what-is-free-software">[<a href="#ref-gnu-what-is-free-software">6</a>]</span>.</p></li>
<li><p>The Open Source Initiative defines it as “<em>software that can be freely accessed, used, changed, and shared (in modified or unmodified form) by anyone. Open source software is made by many people, and distributed under licenses that comply with the Open Source Definition<span class="citation" data-cites="osi-osd">[<a href="#ref-osi-osd">7</a>]</span>.</em>”[<span class="citation" data-cites="osi-faq">[<a href="#ref-osi-faq">8</a>]</span> - <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#osd">What is “Open Source” software?</a>]</p></li>
</ul>
<h3 id="differences">2.2 Differences</h3>
<p>“<em>Open source is a development methodology; free software is a social movement.</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="gnu-os-misses">[<a href="#ref-gnu-os-misses">9</a>]</span> Although often discussed together, they are politically distinct: “free software” being more closely associated with ethics (“<em>essential respect for the users’ freedom</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="gnu-os-misses">[<a href="#ref-gnu-os-misses">9</a>]</span>) and “open source” with pragmatism (i.e., a practical, business-case approach to free software<span class="citation" data-cites="osi-history">[<a href="#ref-osi-history">10</a>]</span>).</p>
<p>The groups’ relationship between free and proprietary software is one of the most defining difference:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Members of the open source community are willing to coexist with the makers of proprietary software<span class="citation" data-cites="open-source-movement-wiki">[<a href="#ref-open-source-movement-wiki">5</a>]</span>,[<span class="citation" data-cites="osi-faq">[<a href="#ref-osi-faq">8</a>]</span> - <a href="https://opensource.org/faq#permissive">What is a “permissive” Open Source license?</a>]] and feel that the issue of whether software is open source is a matter of practicality<span class="citation" data-cites="osi-history">[<a href="#ref-osi-history">10</a>]</span>. One example is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tivoization">tivoization</a>.</p></li>
<li><p>In contrast, members of the free software community maintain the vision that all software is a part of freedom of speech and that proprietary software is unethical and unjust<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/open-source-misses-the-point.en.html"><strong>???</strong></span>,<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.en.html">@https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary.en.html</span>,<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-surveillance.en.html">@https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-surveillance.en.html</span>,<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-back-doors.en.html">@https://www.gnu.org/proprietary/proprietary-back-doors.en.html</span></span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>This differentiation is best reflected by the software licenses used: the open source community allows the use of licenses that permit developing proprietary (i.e., closed sourced) software. This is unacceptable to proponents of free software.</p>
<p>Therefore, on the practical side, every existing free software would qualify as open source because the Open Source Initiative allows the more restrictive (or permissive, depending on the perspective) free software licenses but not vice versa.</p>
<h3 id="introduction-to-licenses">2.3.3 Introduction to licenses</h3>
<h4 id="why-software-licenses-are-necessary">Why software licenses are necessary</h4>
<p>“<em>Licenses are important tools for setting specific terms on which software may be used, modified, or distributed</em>” and they “<em>can be used to facilitate access to software as well as restrict it</em>”.<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406002"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406002"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span> Because the legal default for original works is exclusive copyright, potential users may become discouraged to use a specific piece of code without a license to avoid future litigations as they do not know which limitations owners may want to enforce.<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406002"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3406002"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span></p>
<p>Open collaboration also requires legal ground rules to be layed down because “<em>without a license, everybody who contributes to the project also becomes an exclusive copyright holder of their work. That means nobody can use, copy, distribute, or modify their contributions – and that “nobody” includes the author as well.</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="github.com/github/opensource.guide"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="github.com/github/opensource.guide"><strong>???</strong></span></span></p>
<p>Copyright holders therefore set formal permissions in the form of licenses, especially if they expect their code to be reused.</p>
<h4 id="copyright">2.3.3.1 Copyright</h4>
<p>Copyright grants the creator of an original work exclusive but limited rights<a href="#fn2" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref2"><sup>2</sup></a> for its use and distribution<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright http://www.etymonline.com/word/copyright https://opensource.com/resources/what-is-copyleft"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyright"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://www.etymonline.com/word/copyright"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://opensource.com/resources/what-is-copyleft"><strong>???</strong></span></span> by default under the Berne Convention<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_Implementation_Act_of_1988"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berne_Convention_Implementation_Act_of_1988"><strong>???</strong></span></span>. Authors therefore have complete authority and they have to provide explicitly permit any actions that would involve the use of their work.</p>
<h4 id="public-domain-software">2.3.3.0 Public domain software</h4>
<p>Some developers reject the necessity of software licenses altogether and therefore do not use licenses<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License-free_software"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License-free_software"><strong>???</strong></span></span> or put their work explicitly in the public domain<span class="citation" data-cites="http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html"><strong>???</strong></span></span>.</p>
<p>License-free software are usually avoided because it is not explicitly in the public domain and the absence of a license makes the software fully copyright protected according to the Berne convention.</p>
<p>Dedicating software to the public domain is somewhat better received. Works in the public domain are creative material that are not protected by copyright, trademark or patent laws and can be modified, distributed, or sold even without any attribution by anyone.<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain_software https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain_software"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span> Legal ambiguities still exist however, especially when it comes to software, such as:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>What is the legally accepted way to place software in the public domain?</p>
<p>There are four common ways for works to end up in the public domain: the copyright has expired, forfeited, waived or inapplicable.<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/welcome"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span></p>
<p>Abandoning the copyright is the most pertinent in this case and there is a debate about what methods are legally accepted<span class="citation" data-cites="https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-March/001679.html http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://lists.opensource.org/pipermail/license-review/2012-March/001679.html"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://cr.yp.to/distributors.html"><strong>???</strong></span></span> or whether it can be done at all<a href="#fn3" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref3"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p>How can public domain software be re-used in proprietary software?</p>
<p>Modifications to a public domain work may be protected by copyright<span class="citation" data-cites="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/trouble-spots"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://fairuse.stanford.edu/overview/public-domain/trouble-spots"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span> if the modification is non-trivial (i.e., meets the applicable laws’ originality and creativity requirements)<span class="citation" data-cites="https://copyleft.org/guide/comprehensive-gpl-guidech2.html#x5-50001.1 http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/10-misconceptions-about-the-public-domain.html#five"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://copyleft.org/guide/comprehensive-gpl-guidech2.html#x5-50001.1"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/10-misconceptions-about-the-public-domain.html#five"><strong>???</strong></span></span> and this could be interpreted that only the modification itself can copyrighted<span class="citation" data-cites="http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/10-misconceptions-about-the-public-domain.html#five"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://www.publicdomainsherpa.com/10-misconceptions-about-the-public-domain.html#five"><strong>???</strong></span></span>.</p>
<p>The meaning of “public domain” also depends on jurisdiction<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.quora.com/When-you-create-a-proprietary-software-after-using-quite-a-few-open-source-software-projects-as-a-starting-point-how-is-this-legal https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.quora.com/When-you-create-a-proprietary-software-after-using-quite-a-few-open-source-software-projects-as-a-starting-point-how-is-this-legal"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public_domain"><strong>???</strong></span></span> and licenses are necessary that emulate the public domain, such as CC0<span class="citation" data-cites="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://wiki.creativecommons.org/wiki/CC0"><strong>???</strong></span></span>, Unilicense<span class="citation" data-cites="http://unlicense.org"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://unlicense.org"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span> or WTFPL<span class="citation" data-cites="http://www.wtfpl.net"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://www.wtfpl.net"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span>.</p></li>
</ul>
<h4 id="copyleft">2.3.3.0 Copyleft</h4>
<p>The most exhaustive resource on this topic is the continuously updated Copyleft and the GNU General Public License: A Comprehensive Tutorial and Guide<span class="citation" data-cites="https://copyleft.org/guide"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://copyleft.org/guide"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span> but the following sections try to give a quick summary.</p>
<h5 id="history-and-rationale">2.3.3.0.1 History and rationale</h5>
<p>Since the emergence of computer science, developing and sharing programs was entirely in the public domain, mostly in academia and software was not copyrightable.</p>
<p>In 1974, the US Commission on New Technological Uses of Copyrighted Works (CONTU) decided that “<em>computer programs, to the extent that they embody an author’s original creation, are proper subject matter of copyright</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="http://www.digital-law-online.info/CONTU"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://www.digital-law-online.info/CONTU"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span>.</p>
<p>The Copyright Act of 1976<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/117"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/17/117"><strong>???</strong></span></span> (and following legal precedents, such as Apple v. Franklin<span class="citation" data-cites="https://openjurist.org/714/f2d/1240/apple-computer-inc-v-franklin-computer-corporation"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://openjurist.org/714/f2d/1240/apple-computer-inc-v-franklin-computer-corporation"><strong>???</strong></span></span>) “<em>clarified that the Copyright Act gave computer programs the copyright status of literary works</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain_software"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain_software"><strong>???</strong></span></span>.</p>
<p>The Berne Convention Implementation Act of 1988 puts any original creative works under copyright after creation by default.</p>
<p>The legislation gave rise to the development of proprietary software and helped it become a lucrative business opportunity from the early 1980s, causing the decline of the academic public domain software ecosystem<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_Unix"><strong>???</strong></span></span>.</p>
<p>Richard Stallman, himself an academic and alarmed by the growing trend, founds the GNU Project, and with that, the free software movement. He writes the first version of GNU General Public License in 1989 as a response, to encode public domain rights on software, relying “<em>on the enforceability of the copyright to be effective</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain_software"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Public-domain_software"><strong>???</strong></span></span>.</p>
<h5 id="what-is-copyleft">2.3.3.0.2 What is copyleft?</h5>
<p>Also referred to as <em>reciprocal</em> or <em>protective</em> licensing. The derogatory adjectives “viral” or “infectious” are also used<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viral_license"><strong>???</strong></span></span>. (See <a href="#controversies">Controversies</a>).</p>
<p>It is a form of licensing that retains the author’s exclusive copyrights for works but gives permission to recipients of the work to reproduce, change or distribute it, with the accompanying requirement that any resulting copies or adaptations are also bound by the same licensing agreement. “<em>In essence, copyleft grants freedom, but forbids others to forbid that freedom to anyone else along the distribution and modification chains.</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://copyleft.org/guide"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://copyleft.org/guide"><strong>???</strong></span></span>.(Hence the term “reciprocal”.)</p>
<p>Copyleft software intentionally shares properties with public domain software and by requiring the same copyleft license downstream is an attempt to close one of its loopholes: “<em>any nontrivial modification made to the [public domain] work is fully copyrightable</em>”, ergo “<em>over time, some entities will choose to proprietarize their modified versions</em>” with little “<em>incentive to contribute back to the commons</em>”, until “<em>almost no interesting work is left in the public domain, because nearly all new work is done by proprietarization.</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://copyleft.org/guide"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://copyleft.org/guide"><strong>???</strong></span></span>.</p>
<p>“<em>Copyleft uses functional parts of the copyright system to achieve an unusual result (legal protection for free sharing)</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://copyleft.org/guide"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://copyleft.org/guide"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span>: it modifies copyright law, which is usually employed to strengthen the rights of authors or publishers by prohibiting “<em>recipients from reproducing, adapting, or distributing copies of their work</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft"><strong>???</strong></span></span>, to strengthen instead the rights of users. This reversal is reflected in its name as a wordplay on “copyright”.</p>
<p>The stipulation that the “<em>information necessary for reproducing and modifying the work must be made available to recipients of the binaries</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft"><strong>???</strong></span></span> (i.e., source code) is added to prevent the creation of proprietary products<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/copyleft.html"><strong>???</strong></span></span> and it is probably the most notable difference to public domain software because “<em>an executable program can be in the public domain but the source code is not available</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html"><strong>???</strong></span></span>.</p>
<p>The idea of copyleft can be also applied to works that are not software. These licenses are usually called share-alike (see Creative Commons<span class="citation" data-cites="https://creativecommons.org"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://creativecommons.org"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span>.</p>
<h5 id="types">2.3.3.0.3 Types</h5>
<h6 id="strong-and-weak-copyleft">Strong and weak copyleft</h6>
<p>“<em>“Strong vs. weak” copyleft is not a dichotomy, it’s a spectrum.</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://copyleft.org/guide"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://copyleft.org/guide"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span> “<em>The strength of the copyleft governing a work is an expression of the extent that the copyleft provisions can be efficiently imposed on all kinds of derived[sic] works.</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft"><strong>???</strong></span></span></p>
<p>The stronger the license, the more it will seek to ensure that the same license will cover every version of derivative works, making them subject to its requirements.<span class="citation" data-cites="https://copyleft.org/guide"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://copyleft.org/guide"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span> Practically this means that the corresponding source code has to be made available to licensees. The ideological goal is to ensure the propagations of the software freedoms for each user.</p>
<p>Usually larger end user programs, which cannot be used further as a component, opt in using such licenses to prevent turning them into proprietary products.<a href="#fn4" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref4"><sup>4</sup></a> The versions of the GNU General Public License (GNU GPL) are the most commonly cited examples for strong copyleft.</p>

<p>As the “copyleft” gets weaker, the license starts to introduce “trade offs” such as allowing cases of derivative works that are permitted to use another license and/or keeping parts of the source closed in order to foster wider adoption but still try to hold on to most of copyleft’s principles.<span class="citation" data-cites="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft https://copyleft.org/guide"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Copyleft"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://copyleft.org/guide"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span></p>
<p>The most well-known example for this seemingly counter-intuitive rationale is the history of the GNU Lesser General Public License (GNU LGPL) and “glibc”, the GNU project’s implementation of the C standard library. It was created to provide a common alternative to the world of proliferating proprietary implementations that had limited functionality, sometimes specific only to certain vendors. If it had used a stronger license (such as the GPL), any software created with it would have to be shipped with the same license, thus providing their source code would have been necessary to avoid violation of the license’s terms. “<em>The de-facto standard for the C library on GNU/Linux would likely be not glibc</em>”<span class="citation" data-cites="https://copyleft.org/guide"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://copyleft.org/guide"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span>, a free software, but probably the most popular proprietary one that allows developers to create proprietary software.</p>

<p>On the contrary, open source code can be obtained free of charge but all sources agree that there are hidden costs (if not about their extent).<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/the-open-source-conundrum-3-benefits-and-drawbacks-to-consider https://jaxenter.com/think-open-source-software-free-think-131436.html https://crowdsourcedtesting.com/resources/pros-cons-open-source-software http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/reasons-organizations-opt-not-use-open-source-software https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/the-open-source-conundrum-3-benefits-and-drawbacks-to-consider http://entrepreneurhandbook.co.uk/open-source-software https://crowdsourcedtesting.com/resources/pros-cons-open-source-software roads-and-bridges"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/the-open-source-conundrum-3-benefits-and-drawbacks-to-consider"><strong>???</strong></span>/, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://jaxenter.com/think-open-source-software-free-think-131436.html"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://crowdsourcedtesting.com/resources/pros-cons-open-source-software"><strong>???</strong></span>/, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/reasons-organizations-opt-not-use-open-source-software"><strong>???</strong></span>, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.americanexpress.com/us/small-business/openforum/articles/the-open-source-conundrum-3-benefits-and-drawbacks-to-consider"><strong>???</strong></span>/, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://entrepreneurhandbook.co.uk/open-source-software"><strong>???</strong></span>/, <span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://crowdsourcedtesting.com/resources/pros-cons-open-source-software"><strong>???</strong></span>/, [<a href="#ref-roads-and-bridges">2</a>]</span> and the next items expand on the nature of these. Their categorization into pros and cons is not straightforward because it depends on the scope of the adopting organization and the parties involved making their case.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Risk of abandonment of dependent projects.</strong></p>
<p>The argument stems from the fear of the decentralized open source workflow and that project governance is unclear in many cases.</p>
<p>On the other hand this fear is also valid regarding proprietary software: companies phase out older products or functionality (sometimes without any notice) regardless of users relying on them (e.g., subsequent iterations of Microsoft products routinely defy assumptions based on previous versions) and even profiting from offering additional transitional support.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Support and ongoing maintenance</strong></p>
<p>Commercial proprietary products are traditionally shipped with guaranteed support whereas open source is perceived to lack this level of care<span class="citation" data-cites="http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/reasons-organizations-opt-not-use-open-source-software"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://thevarguy.com/open-source-application-software-companies/reasons-organizations-opt-not-use-open-source-software"><strong>???</strong></span></span>. This may be due to the fact that it is not stated explicitly in every project but is an intrinsic part of open source culture:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>documentation is kept up to date</p></li>
<li><p>communities around a project have mailing lists, chat rooms, meet-ups set up (even regular office hours specified!<span class="citation" data-cites="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/gpl-primer"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://make.wordpress.org/community/handbook/wordcamp-organizer/planning-details/gpl-primer"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span></p></li>
<li><p>sites dedicated to answering questions of almost any nature, such as Stackoverflow or Quora</p></li>
<li><p>issues and feature requests can be directly opened on the project’s source code repository (e.g., on Github)</p></li>
<li><p>as a last resort, the source code is always available</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Open source companies also offer commercial support as part of their business model.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Commercial support for proprietary software on the other hand can be so poor that another company needs to be hired for deployment and for ongoing operations. The worst case scenario is that local staff takes up the mantle even though they had no role in development and have little ability to do anything else other than coming up with workarounds by trial and error as the implementation details are not known.<span class="citation" data-cites="osmovement">[<a href="#ref-osmovement">12</a>]</span></p>
<pre><code>This brings up the issue of control:</code></pre>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Control</strong></p>
<p>Proprietary vendors have iron grip over the software’s functionality and future evolution. Monopolies eliminate any upstart innovators, effectively locking the organizations into a platform with the ability to demand any price.</p>
<p>Open source’s alluring promise is to return control. over the tools one would like to use and how one would like to use them.</p>
<p>Examples to the former are alternatives to proprietary software such as Control over the choice of tools one would like to use:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>OpenOffice instead of Microsoft Office</p></li>
<li><p>Linux, BSD or other open source operating systems instead of Microsoft Windows or Apple Mac OS X<a href="#fn9" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref9"><sup>9</sup></a></p></li>
<li><p>FreeSWITCH instead of Avaya IP Office</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Control over how one would like to use these tools:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Restrictions of proprietary software licenses are able to limit any aspect of a program (such as JAWS, Raiser’s Edge, EyeCare, Microsoft Office): the number of times a software can be installed, the number of computers it can be present simultaneously, the number of database records, the date until it can be used and so on.</p>
<p>Alternatives, such as NVDA, CiviCRM, OpenERM, OpenOffice etc. do not have these restrictions.</p></li>
<li><p>Avaya IP Office phone system only allows certain functionality in combination with specific hardware (and even then it is not guaranteed).</p>
<p>FreeSWITCH may be compiled on any commodity hardware and can be extended programmatically or by community modules.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Control over one’s own data because by the lack of regulations, users’ have little authority over what should happen to their voluntarily supplied information to large corporations<span class="citation" data-cites="https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21721656-data-economy-demands-new-approach-antitrust-rules-worlds-most-valuable-resource"><strong>???</strong></span></span>. Open Stack is one solution to create a private or public cloud on any available hardware.</p></li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Standards and tools</strong></p>
<p>Ever since the business opportunity of selling software has been recognized, companies have been creating programs to solve a specific problem (networking, data management, etc.) with the intent of successful commercial distribution. Many times the problem domains have been complex enough to develop a proprietary standard solution and patent it, leading the way to reinvent the wheel over and over. Overall secrecy made it difficult to prove the superiority of one product over the other and typically the corporation with the most resources and/or better marketing campaign prevailed.</p>
<p>Adopting organizations still require long periods of deliberation before purchasing any proprietary software suite because:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>The rigidness of the tools would require adjusting organizational processes and workflows (i.e., serving the tool instead of the other way around)</p></li>
<li><p>It would lock them in in the long haul. Reasons include:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>information is stored in a proprietary format</p></li>
<li><p>no interoperation with other vendor’s products</p></li>
<li><p>accumulated experience would not translate to other similar solutions requiring re-training and/or new hires</p></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>With the emergence of the free and the open source movement large-scale collaboration on <em>open standards</em> became the norm. Proprietary software could still be built upon them but many went down the open source path. Of course this led to the proliferation of tools but now one had a choice even if in the end a proprietary product ended up being use. Open standards also incentivized corporations to get involved as more and more customers started to trust the new process of laying down the foundations of a new technology in the open.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Qualified labor</strong></p>
<p>Proprietary software usually has one setup for each use case (because many times they are tied to a specific proprietary hardware) that makes life easier but this ease comes with the aforementioned costs. Vendors usually sell trainings and certifications for individuals and/or they provide support services to help operations. Such specialization comes with high prices and limits the mobility of the workforce (i.e., seek opportunitites only at companies with the same equipment or setup).</p>
<p>The learning curve of open source is steeper but becoming versed in its ways may yield many advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Individuals get a reusable set of skills and a more holistic view of how principles from multiple fields can be tied together.</p>
<p>Specialization to proprietary systems is easier using this path because companies use their own obfuscated terminology based on marketing buzzwords whereas the underlying principles have their standard terminology rooted in (academic) research. Open standards used the latter as clarity is crucial in wide-spread adoption.</p></li>
<li><p>Organizations lay down a foundation for future flexibility and continuous improvement.</p>
<p>Open source has a vibrant community based around popular and well documented programming languages and frameworks with their own support support networks sharing the same infrastructure (e.g., Github, Stackoverflow, Slack). Switches between <em>technology stacks</em> are common and seamless because the underlying tools are the same and/or based on similar principles.</p>
<p>Adopted tools can also be further specialized/improved and these modifications can be contributed back to the larger community.</p></li>
<li><p>Wide-spread availability promotes easy entry for anyone interested</p></li>
<li><p>Most people working on open source projects are characterized mostly by enthusiasm<span class="citation" data-cites="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-352-managing-innovation-emerging-trends-spring-2005/readings/lakhaniwolf.pdf"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="https://ocw.mit.edu/courses/sloan-school-of-management/15-352-managing-innovation-emerging-trends-spring-2005/readings/lakhaniwolf.pdf"><strong>???</strong></span></span></p></li>
</ul></li>
<li><p><strong>Security</strong></p>
<p>Proponents of open source believe in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus%27s_Law">Linus’ Law</a><span class="citation" data-cites="bazaar">[<a href="#ref-bazaar">13</a>]</span>: open source project are more widely available to the publicand more eyes mean higher chances to discover a (security) bug.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>Although this statement has not been proved by any major research and it relies on questionable assumptions.<span class="citation" data-cites="http://www.zdnet.com/article/six-open-source-security-myths-debunked-and-eight-real-challenges-to-consider"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://www.zdnet.com/article/six-open-source-security-myths-debunked-and-eight-real-challenges-to-consider"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span> The most widely publicized open source vulnerability was the OpenSSL Heartbleed bug<span class="citation" data-cites="http://heartbleed.com"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="http://heartbleed.com"><strong>???</strong></span>/</span> but the causes leading up to it are more complex than a simple oversight.<a href="#fn10" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref10"><sup>10</sup></a>. Security issues tend to be disclosed almost as soon as they are discovered though, as opposed to proprietary bugs.</p>
<ul>
<li><p><strong>Compliance requirements</strong></p>
<p>Software compliance means to keep track of all the copyright notices and licenses, and oblige to their requirements. Compliance tracking is also important to document the software supply chain (e.g. to be able to produce a Bill of Materials on request) and to respond quickly to a newly disclosed security vulnerability (i.e., to know which parts are affected, if any).</p>
<p>From a software development standpoint, large corporations have advantage as they usually own all of the source code. Even if they incorporate open source projects in their closed source product(s), they have the legal apparatus to tip the scale to their favour should it come to a legal dispute over license ambiguities. Therefore in the case of proprietary software, the burden of compliance falls to the users, especially if the products are going to be used in a commercial setting.</p>
<p>With open source software the users are the clear winners because they have complete freedom on how to use the products and they only have to satisfy license obligations if they are planning on commercial re-distribution of the (modified) works or if they would like to create a proprietary product from open source projects.<a href="#fn11" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref11"><sup>11</sup></a></p></li>

<p>For example, GNU Ada<a href="#fn12" class="footnote-ref" id="fnref12"><sup>12</sup></a> is developed by a company. It is always distributed under the terms of the GNU GPL, and every copy is free software; but its developers sell support contracts. When their salesmen speak to prospective customers, sometimes the customers say, “We would feel safer with a commercial compiler.” The salesmen reply, “GNU Ada is a commercial compiler; it happens to be free software.”<span class="citation" data-cites="GNU"><span class="citeproc-not-found" data-reference-id="GNU"><strong>???</strong></span>’s “Categories of free and nonfree software” https://www.gnu.org/philosophy/categories.en.html#commercialSoftware</span></p>
